1). The unemployment rate is calculated based on a particular region, so to analyze unemployment 
I will be using an unemployment dataset of India. The dataset I’m using here contains data on India’s 
unemployment rate during Covid-19. So let’s start the task of Unemployment analysis by importing the 
necessary Python libraries and the dataset:

2). Let’s see if this dataset contains missing values or not:

3). While analyzing the missing values, I found that the column names are not correct. So, for a
 better understanding of this data, I will rename all the columns:

4). Now let’s have a look at the correlation between the features of this dataset:

5).Now let’s visualize the data to analyze the unemployment rate. I will first take a look at the estimated
 number of employees according to different regions of India:

6).Now let’s see the unemployment rate according to different regions of India:

7).Now let’s create a dashboard to analyze the unemployment rate of each Indian state by region. For this,
 I’ll use a sunburst plot:

8).So this is how you can analyze the unemployment rate by using the Python programming language.
 Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of people who are unemployed as a
 percentage of the total labour force. I hope you liked this article on unemployment rate analysis with Python.
